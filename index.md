# Areas of Interest
My area of work is Machine Learning (specifically Deep Learning) with Computer Vision. My research interests include the interpretabiltity of cutting edge Deep Learning models and their practical significance for real-time applications. With this goal in mind, I have worked in the area of Model Compression and Efficient Computations in deep neural networks, mainly for image related tasks. Following the similar lines, I have explored the area of efficient video classification.
